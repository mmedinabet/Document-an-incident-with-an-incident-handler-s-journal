<h1>Document an Incident with an Incident Handler's Journal</h2> 


<h2>Description</h2>
A small US healthcare clinic specializing in primary-care services suffered a security breach one Tuesday morning around 9:00 a.m. Employees found their computers locked out from accessing files, including medical records, leading to a shutdown of business operations. The incident involved a ransom note displayed on the computers, claiming that a group of unethical hackers had encrypted all company files. To regain access, a significant ransom was demanded in exchange for the decryption key. The attack was initiated through targeted phishing emails, which contained a malicious attachment causing malware installation when opened. The hackers entered the network, deployed ransomware, and encrypted vital files, particularly patient data, causing severe disruptions. As a result, the company had to halt computer systems, notify relevant authorities, and seek technical support.
